# WLED-DMX-Brick
I Build this brick with an DMX In and Out and an ESP32-S3 with WLED in the middle.
The use case is to put it in a DMX line, and have an automatic scene on boot and a simplified UI for controlling the Lamps but it is always possible to control the Lamps by the central DMX-Master for the bigger events in the house.

I used:
ESP32-S3 Mini / Zero
SN75176
Neutrik XLR 
NC3FAAH
NC3MAAH

All in a 3D printed box. https://www.printables.com/model/1100733-dmx-wled-brick
